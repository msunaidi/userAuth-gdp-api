// TODO: Create a route that will do the following:
// 1. Handle a POST request to /auth/login that will take in an email and password as the request body
//      and will return a JSON object with a token property. This token SHOULD be stored in the database.
// 2. Handle a POST request to /auth/profile that will take in a token in the request header with key Authentication.
//      Our clients should send the token in the following format: "Bearer <token>". for example:
//      "Bearer 1234567890". If the token is valid, then return a JSON object with the user's profile.
